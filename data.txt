APPLICATION

When the air temperature is at 35°F (1.7°C), substrates may be colder; prior to painting, check to be sure the air, surface, and material temperature are above 35°F (1.7°C) and at least 5°F above the dew point. Avoid using if rain or snow is expected within 30 minutes.
Do not apply at air or surface temperatures below 35°F (1.7°C) or when air or surface temperatures may drop below 35°F (1.7°C) within 48 hours.
No reduction needed.

Brush:
Use a nylon-polyester brush.

Roller:
Use a high quality 3/8-3/4 inch nap synthetic roller cover.

For specific brushes and rollers, please refer to our Brush and Roller Guide on sherwin- williams.com

Pressure	2000 p.s.i.
Tip	0 15-.019 inch

APPLICATION TIPS
Make sure product is completely agitated (mechanically or manually) before use.

Thoroughly follow the recommended surface preparations. Most coating failures are due to inadequate surface preparation or application. Thorough surface preparation will help provide long term protection with Latitude coating.
 
SPECIFICATIONS
Latitude can be self-priming when used directly over existing coatings, or exterior bare drywall, plaster and masonry (with a cured pH of less than 9). The first coat acts like a coat of primer and the second coat provides the final appearance and performance. Please note that some specific surfaces require specialized treatment.
Use on these properly prepared surfaces:
Aluminum & Aluminum Siding1, Galvanized Steel1:
2 coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Concrete Block, CMU, Split face Block:
1 coat Loxon Acrylic Block Surfacer 2 coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Brick, Stucco, Cement, Concrete:
1	coat Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer (if needed)
or
Loxon Conditioner (if needed)
2	coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Cement Composition Siding/Panels:
1	coat Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer (if needed)
or
Loxon Conditioner (if needed)
2	coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Plywood:
1	coat Exterior Latex Primer
2	coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
*Vinyl Siding:
2 coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Wood (Cedar, Redwood):
1 coat Exterior Oil-Based Wood Primer 2 coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Knots and some woods, such as redwood and cedar, contain a high amount of tannin, a colored wood extract. For best results on these woods, use a coat of Exterior Oil-Based Wood Primer.
Wood Composition Board - Hardiboard: Because of the potential for wax bleeding out of the substrate, apply 1 coat of Exterior Oil-Based Wood Primer and then topcoat.
1 On large expanses of metal siding, the air, surface, and material temperatures must be 50°F (10°) or higher.
Standard latex primers cannot be used below 50°F (10°C) or above 100°F (37.7°C). See specific primer label for that product’s application limitations.

Other primers may be appropriate.

When repainting involves a drastic color change, a coat of primer will improve the hiding performance of the topcoat color.

SURFACE PREPARATION
WARNING! If you scrape, sand or remove old paint, you may release lead dust. LEAD IS TOXIC. EXPOSURE TO LEAD DUST CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ILLNESS, SUCH AS BRAIN DAMAGE, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN. PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD ALSO AVOID
EXPOSURE. Wear a NIOSH-approved respirator to control lead exposure. Clean up carefully with a HEPA vacuum and a wet mop. Before you start, find out how to protect yourself and your family by contacting the National Lead Information Hotline at 1-800-424-LEAD or log on to www.epa.gov/lead.
Remove all surface contamination by washing with an appropriate cleaner, rinse thoroughly and allow to dry. Existing peeled or checked paint should be scraped and sanded to a sound surface. Glossy surfaces should be sanded dull. Stains from water, smoke, ink, pencil, grease, etc. should be sealed with the appropriate primer- sealer. Recognize that any surface preparation short of total removal of the old coating may compromise the service length of the system.
Aluminum and Galvanized Steel:
Wash to remove any oil, grease, or other surface contamination. All corrosion must be removed with sandpaper, wire brush, or other abrading method. On large expanses of metal siding, the air, surface, and material temperatures must be 50°F or higher.
Cement Composition Siding-Panels:
Remove all dirt, dust, grease, oil, loose particles, laitance, foreign material, and peeling or defective coatings. Allow the surface to dry thoroughly. If the surface is new, test it for pH, if the pH is higher than 9, prime with Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer. After power washing, previously painted masonry may still have a powdery surface that should be sealed with Loxon Conditioner.
Caulking:
Gaps between windows, doors, trim, and other through-wall openings can be filled with the appropriate caulk after priming the surface.
Masonry, Concrete, Cement, Block:
All new surfaces must be cured according to the supplier’s recommendations – usually about 30 days. Remove all form release and curing agents. Rough surfaces can be filled to provide a smooth surface. If painting cannot wait 30 days, allow the surface to cure 7 days and prime the surface with Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer. Cracks, voids, and other holes should be repaired with an elastomeric patch or sealant. Concrete masonry units (CMU) - Surface should be thoroughly clean and dry. Air, material and surface temperatures must be at least 50°F (10°C) before filling. Use Loxon Acrylic Block Surfacer. The filler must be thoroughly dry before topcoating.
Previously Painted Surfaces:
Spot prime bare areas, wait 4 hours, and paint the entire surface. Some specific surfaces require specialized treatment.
 
SURFACE PREPARATION
Mildew:
Prior to attempting to remove mildew, it is always recommended to test any cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area prior to use. Bleach and bleaching type cleaners may damage or discolor existing paint films. Bleach alternative cleaning solutions may be advised. Mildew may be removed before painting by washing with a solution of 1 part liquid bleach and 3 parts clean water. Apply the solution and scrub the mildewed area. Allow the solution to remain on the surface for 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow the surface to dry before painting. Wear protective eyewear, waterproof gloves, and protective clothing. Quickly wash off any of the mixture that comes in contact with your skin. Do not add detergents or ammonia to the bleach- water solution.
Wood:
Sand any exposed wood to a fresh surface. Patch all holes and imperfections with a wood filler or putty and sand smooth. All patched areas must be primed.
Steel:
Rust and mill scale must be removed using sandpaper, wire brush, or other abrading method. Bare steel must be primed the same day as cleaned.
Stucco:
Remove any loose stucco, efflorescence, or laitance. Allow new stucco to cure at least 30 days before painting. If painting cannot wait 30 days, allow the surface to dry 7 days and prime with Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer. Repair cracks, voids, and other holes with an elastomeric patch or sealant.
*Vinyl or other PVC Building Products:
Clean the surface thoroughly by scrubbing with warm, soapy water. Rinse thoroughly, if needed prime with appropriate white primer. Do not paint vinyl with any color darker than the original color or having a Light Reflective Value (LRV) of less than 56 unless VinylSafe® Colors are used. If VinylSafe colors are not used the vinyl may warp. Follow all painting guidelines of the vinyl manufacturer when painting. Only paint properly installed vinyl siding. Deviating from the manufacturer’s painting guidelines may cause the warranty to be voided.

SURFACE PREPARATION
WARNING! Removal of old paint by sanding, scraping or other means may generate dust or fumes that contain lead. Exposure to lead dust or fumes may cause brain damage or other adverse health effects, especially in children or pregnant women. Controlling exposure to lead or other hazardous substances requires the use of proper protective equipment, such as    a properly fitted respirator (NIOSH approved) and proper containment and cleanup. For more information, call the National Lead Information Center at 1-800-424-LEAD (in US) or contact your local health authority.


Remove all existing paint and replace any deteriorated substrate. Although this can be applied over earlier semi-transparent stains, some of the old color may be visible through this semi-transparent film. Recognize that any surface preparation short of total removal of the old coating may compromise the service length of the system.
Remove all surface contamination by washing with an appropriate cleaner to remove all dirt, air pollution, chalk, etc., especially in areas not exposed to direct weathering such as under eaves and porch ceilings.  Rinse  and  allow the surface to dry. Test the absorbency of the wood by sprinkling water on the surface. If the water penetrates into the wood quickly, the wood is ready to finish. If the water beads up  or does not penetrate, remove existing finish or contaminant. Then test for absorbency again. Do not apply coating over wet or damp surfaces.
Caulking:
Apply appropriate caulking and patching material to cracks, nail holes, or other surface imperfections. Filled areas will take the stain differently than bare wood.
Consider using a caulk that is a color similar to the stain color.
 
SURFACE PREPARATION
Mildew:
Prior to attempting to remove mildew, it is always recommended to test any cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area prior to use. Bleach and bleaching type cleaners may damage or discolor existing paint films. Bleach alternative cleaning solutions may be advised.
Mildew may be removed before painting by washing with a solution of 1 part liquid bleach and 3 parts water. Apply the solution and scrub the mildewed area. Allow the solution to remain on the surface for 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with water and allow the surface to dry before painting. Wear protective eyewear, waterproof gloves, and protective clothing. Quickly wash off any of the mixture that comes in contact with your skin. Do not add detergents or ammonia to the bleach-water solution.
Mill Glaze:
Is a glossy finish on new, smooth sawn wood or on the peaks of some textured wood. This must be removed by sanding to allow the stain to penetrate.

Pressure Treated Wood:
Test the absorbency of the wood by sprinkling water on the surface. If the water penetrates into the wood quickly,  the wood is ready to finish.   If the water beads up or does not penetrate, remove existing finish or contaminant. Then test for absorbency again. Do not apply coating over wet or damp surfaces. Prepare the surface like any other wood surface.
Due to the green tone of many brands of pressure treated lumber, the color of the stain may look different from the color selected. Check the color on a test area prior to staining the entire project.

Smooth or Rough Wood Siding and Plywood:
Sand any exposed wood to a fresh surface. Replace any deteriorated wood.

APPLICATION TIPS
For touching-up, reduce the product by one pint per gallon.
To assure maximum washability and durability, wait at least 14 days before washing Duration Home Coating.
When removing stains, dirt, and marks, use a soft cloth or sponge with water. Stubborn stains may require the use of a general purpose household cleaner for total removal. Do not use an abrasive cleaner or scrub brush to remove stains.
Surfactant leaching  is  a  term  used  when a concentration of water-soluble paint ingredients called “surfactants” are noticed on the surface of a latex paint film. Surfactant leaching is most commonly seen as a streak or stain of tan, brown, or clear spots that sometimes can be glossy, soapy, oily or even sticky. Surfactants are soap-like materials that help in the dispersion of the paint’s pigment and latex binders.
Duration Home with Moisture Resistant Technology has excellent resistance to surfactant leaching when applied  on  new or existing substrates. However, surfactants can remain on existing painted surfaces if not removed prior to coating. Existing painted surfaces must be thoroughly washed clean and allowed to dry prior to applying any finish.

SURFACE PREPARATION
WARNING! Removal of old paint by sanding, scraping or other means may generate dust or fumes that contain lead. Exposure to lead dust or fumes may cause brain damage or other adverse health effects, especially in children or pregnant women. Controlling exposure to lead or other hazardous substances requires the use of proper protective equipment,  such as  a properly fitted respirator (NIOSH approved) and proper containment and cleanup. For more information, call the National Lead Information Center at 1-800-424-LEAD (in US) or contact your local health authority.
Remove all surface contamination by washing with an appropriate cleaner, rinse thoroughly and allow to dry. Existing peeled or checked paint should be scraped and sanded to a sound surface. Glossy surfaces should be sanded dull. Stains from water, smoke, ink, pencil, grease, etc. should be sealed with the appropriate primer/sealer. Recognize that any surface preparation short of total removal of the old coating may compromise the service length of the system.
Caulking:
Gaps between walls, ceilings, crown moldings, and other interior trim can be filled with the appropriate caulk after priming the surface.
Drywall:
Fill cracks and holes with patching paste- spackle and sand smooth. Joint compounds must be cured and sanded smooth. Remove all sanding dust.
Masonry, Concrete, Cement, Block:
All new surfaces must  be  cured  according  to the supplier’s recommendations—usually about 30 days. Remove all form release and curing agents. Rough surfaces can be filled to provide a smooth surface. If painting cannot wait 30 days, allow the surface to cure 7 days and prime the surface with Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer.
 

SURFACE PREPARATION
Mildew:
Prior to attempting to remove mildew, it is always recommended to test any cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area prior to use. Bleach and bleaching type cleaners may damage or discolor existing paint films. Bleach alternative cleaning solutions may be advised.
Mildew may be removed before painting by washing with a solution of 1 part liquid bleach and 3 parts water. Apply the solution and scrub the mildewed area. Allow the solution to remain on the surface for 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with water and allow the surface to dry before painting. Wear protective eyewear, waterproof gloves, and protective clothing. Quickly wash off any of the mixture that comes in contact with your skin. Do not add detergents or ammonia to the bleach-water solution.
Plaster:
Bare plaster must be cured and hard. Textured, soft, porous, or powdery plaster should be treated with a solution of 1 pint household vinegar to 1 gallon of water. Repeat until the surface is hard, rinse with clear water and allow to dry.
Wood:
Sand any exposed wood to a fresh surface. Patch all holes and imperfections with a wood filler or putty and sand smooth.

SURFACE PREPARATION
Mildew:
Prior to attempting to remove mildew, it is always recommended to test any cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area prior to use. Bleach and bleaching type cleaners may damage or discolor existing paint films. Bleach alternative cleaning solutions may be advised.
Mildew may be removed before painting by washing with a solution of 1 part liquid bleach and 3 parts water. Apply the solution and scrub the mildewed area. Allow the solution to remain on the surface for 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with water and allow the surface to dry before painting. Wear protective eyewear, waterproof gloves, and protective clothing. Quickly wash off any of the mixture that comes in contact with your skin. Do not add detergents or ammonia to the bleach-water solution.
Previously Painted Surfaces:
If in sound condition, clean the surface of all foreign material. Smooth, hard or glossy coatings and surfaces should be dulled by abrading the surface. Apply a test area, allowing paint to dry one week before testing adhesion. If adhesion is poor, additional abrasion of the surface and/ or removal of the previous coating may be necessary. Retest surface for adhesion. If paint is peeling or badly weathered, clean surface to sound substrate and treat as a new surface as above. Recognize that any surface preparation short of total removal of the old coating may compromise the service length of the system.
Steel:
Rust and mill scale must be removed using sandpaper, wire brush, or other abrading method. Bare steel must be primed the same day as cleaned.
*Vinyl or other PVC Building Products:
Clean the surface thoroughly by scrubbing  with warm, soapy water. Rinse thoroughly, if needed prime with appropriate white primer. Do not paint vinyl with any color darker than the original color or having a Light Reflective Value (LRV) of less than 56 unless VinylSafe® Colors are used. If VinylSafe colors are not used the vinyl may warp. Follow all painting guidelines  of the vinyl manufacturer when painting. Only paint properly installed vinyl siding. Deviating from the manufacturer’s painting guidelines may cause the warranty to be voided.
Wood, Plywood, Composition Board:
Clean the surface thoroughly then sand any ex- posed wood to a fresh surface. Patch all holes and imperfections with a wood filler or putty and sand smooth. All new and patched areas must be primed. Knots and some woods, such as redwood and cedar, contain a high amount of tannin, a colored wood extract. If applied to these bare woods, it may show some staining. If staining persists, spot prime severe areas with 1 coat of Exterior Oil-Based Wood Primer prior to using.

APPLICATION

When the air temperature is at 35°F (1.7°C), substrates may be colder; prior to painting, check to be sure the air, surface, and material temperature are above 35°F (1.7°C) and at least 5°F above the dew point. Avoid using if rain or snow is expected within 30 minutes.
Do not apply at air or surface temperatures below 35°F (1.7°C) or when air or surface temperatures may drop below 35°F (1.7°C) within 48 hours.
No reduction needed.

Brush:
Use a nylon-polyester brush.

Roller:
Use a high quality 3/8-3/4 inch nap synthetic roller cover.

For specific brushes and rollers, please refer to our Brush and Roller Guide on sherwin- williams.com

Spray - Airless:
Pressure	2000 p.s.i.
Tip	0 15-.019 inch

APPLICATION TIPS
Make sure product is completely agitated (mechanically or manually) before use.

Thoroughly follow the recommended surface preparations. Most coating failures are due to inadequate surface preparation or application. Thorough surface preparation will help provide long term protection with Latitude coating.
 
SPECIFICATIONS
Latitude can be self-priming when used directly over existing coatings, or exterior bare drywall, plaster and masonry (with a cured pH of less than 9). The first coat acts like a coat of primer and the second coat provides the final appearance and performance. Please note that some specific surfaces require specialized treatment.
Use on these properly prepared surfaces:
Aluminum & Aluminum Siding1, Galvanized Steel1:
2 coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Concrete Block, CMU, Split face Block:
1 coat Loxon Acrylic Block Surfacer 2 coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Brick, Stucco, Cement, Concrete:
1	coat Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer (if needed)
or
Loxon Conditioner (if needed)
2	coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Cement Composition Siding/Panels:
1	coat Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer (if needed)
or
Loxon Conditioner (if needed)
2	coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Plywood:
1	coat Exterior Latex Primer
2	coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
*Vinyl Siding:
2 coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Wood (Cedar, Redwood):
1 coat Exterior Oil-Based Wood Primer 2 coats Latitude Exterior Acrylic
Knots and some woods, such as redwood and cedar, contain a high amount of tannin, a colored wood extract. For best results on these woods, use a coat of Exterior Oil-Based Wood Primer.
Wood Composition Board - Hardiboard: Because of the potential for wax bleeding out of the substrate, apply 1 coat of Exterior Oil-Based Wood Primer and then topcoat.
1 On large expanses of metal siding, the air, surface, and material temperatures must be 50°F (10°) or higher.
Standard latex primers cannot be used below 50°F (10°C) or above 100°F (37.7°C). See specific primer label for that product’s application limitations.

Other primers may be appropriate.

When repainting involves a drastic color change, a coat of primer will improve the hiding performance of the topcoat color.

SURFACE PREPARATION
WARNING! If you scrape, sand or remove old paint, you may release lead dust. LEAD IS TOXIC. EXPOSURE TO LEAD DUST CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ILLNESS, SUCH AS BRAIN DAMAGE, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN. PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD ALSO AVOID
EXPOSURE. Wear a NIOSH-approved respirator to control lead exposure. Clean up carefully with a HEPA vacuum and a wet mop. Before you start, find out how to protect yourself and your family by contacting the National Lead Information Hotline at 1-800-424-LEAD or log on to www.epa.gov/lead.
Remove all surface contamination by washing with an appropriate cleaner, rinse thoroughly and allow to dry. Existing peeled or checked paint should be scraped and sanded to a sound surface. Glossy surfaces should be sanded dull. Stains from water, smoke, ink, pencil, grease, etc. should be sealed with the appropriate primer- sealer. Recognize that any surface preparation short of total removal of the old coating may compromise the service length of the system.
Aluminum and Galvanized Steel:
Wash to remove any oil, grease, or other surface contamination. All corrosion must be removed with sandpaper, wire brush, or other abrading method. On large expanses of metal siding, the air, surface, and material temperatures must be 50°F or higher.
Cement Composition Siding-Panels:
Remove all dirt, dust, grease, oil, loose particles, laitance, foreign material, and peeling or defective coatings. Allow the surface to dry thoroughly. If the surface is new, test it for pH, if the pH is higher than 9, prime with Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer. After power washing, previously painted masonry may still have a powdery surface that should be sealed with Loxon Conditioner.
Caulking:
Gaps between windows, doors, trim, and other through-wall openings can be filled with the appropriate caulk after priming the surface.
Masonry, Concrete, Cement, Block:
All new surfaces must be cured according to the supplier’s recommendations – usually about 30 days. Remove all form release and curing agents. Rough surfaces can be filled to provide a smooth surface. If painting cannot wait 30 days, allow the surface to cure 7 days and prime the surface with Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer. Cracks, voids, and other holes should be repaired with an elastomeric patch or sealant. Concrete masonry units (CMU) - Surface should be thoroughly clean and dry. Air, material and surface temperatures must be at least 50°F (10°C) before filling. Use Loxon Acrylic Block Surfacer. The filler must be thoroughly dry before topcoating.
Previously Painted Surfaces:
Spot prime bare areas, wait 4 hours, and paint the entire surface. Some specific surfaces require specialized treatment.
 
SURFACE PREPARATION
Mildew:
Prior to attempting to remove mildew, it is always recommended to test any cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area prior to use. Bleach and bleaching type cleaners may damage or discolor existing paint films. Bleach alternative cleaning solutions may be advised. Mildew may be removed before painting by washing with a solution of 1 part liquid bleach and 3 parts clean water. Apply the solution and scrub the mildewed area. Allow the solution to remain on the surface for 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow the surface to dry before painting. Wear protective eyewear, waterproof gloves, and protective clothing. Quickly wash off any of the mixture that comes in contact with your skin. Do not add detergents or ammonia to the bleach- water solution.
Wood:
Sand any exposed wood to a fresh surface. Patch all holes and imperfections with a wood filler or putty and sand smooth. All patched areas must be primed.
Steel:
Rust and mill scale must be removed using sandpaper, wire brush, or other abrading method. Bare steel must be primed the same day as cleaned.
Stucco:
Remove any loose stucco, efflorescence, or laitance. Allow new stucco to cure at least 30 days before painting. If painting cannot wait 30 days, allow the surface to dry 7 days and prime with Loxon Concrete & Masonry Primer. Repair cracks, voids, and other holes with an elastomeric patch or sealant.
*Vinyl or other PVC Building Products:
Clean the surface thoroughly by scrubbing with warm, soapy water. Rinse thoroughly, if needed prime with appropriate white primer. Do not paint vinyl with any color darker than the original color or having a Light Reflective Value (LRV) of less than 56 unless VinylSafe® Colors are used. If VinylSafe colors are not used the vinyl may warp. Follow all painting guidelines of the vinyl manufacturer when painting. Only paint properly installed vinyl siding. Deviating from the manufacturer’s painting guidelines may cause the warranty to be voided.
